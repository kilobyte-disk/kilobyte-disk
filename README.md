# Welcome.

Hi, I'm kilobyte-disk.

I enjoy making silly, random things for fun.
I mostly use C/C++ and Python, but eventually I want to learn Rust as well.

I prefer to use a minimal development environment, just vim, NERDTree, and a terminal.
Preferably on a distro like Debian or Arch, something rock solid with lots of good documentation.

Currently, I'm sharpening my skills by writing a game with [raylib](https://raylib.com/index.html).
Hopefully, if it goes well, I'll open source it.
